- [x] Organize home page better
- [x] add projects from array
- [x] organize the scroll bar links to where they're in the project
    - [x] This kind of works, but the offset is wrong, projects end up at 40% height, instead of 75, as they're near the bottom
- [x] When clicking contact me opens up email app with credentials already in
- [x] AURORA needs outline and transparent text
- [ ] Main background as grid but distorted?
- [/] animations for when elements appear on page
    - [ ] animations for projects
    - [ ] div element hiding the text
- [ ] animations when elements enter the viewport for the first time
- [ ] images for my projects
- [ ] possibly images for different technologies, rather than writing them in text in the projects, still should be left as text on the resume part, as to be more professional?
